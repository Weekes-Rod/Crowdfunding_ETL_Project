# Crowdfunding_ETL_Project

## Overview
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) mini project involves building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions. The pipeline extracts and transforms data from Excel files and creates CSV files and a PostgreSQL database based on the transformed data.

## Repository Setup
**Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your computer:
    ```
    git clone <[https://github.com/Weekes-Rod/Crowdfunding_ETL_Project]>
    ```

## Project Details
1. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Extract and transform data from Excel files (`crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx`) using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions.
2. **CSV File Creation**: Create four CSV files based on the transformed data:
   - `category.csv`: Contains category information.
   - `subcategory.csv`: Contains subcategory information.
   - `campaign.csv`: Contains campaign information.
   - `contacts.csv`: Contains contact information.
3. **Database Creation**: Sketch an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) based on the transformed data and create a PostgreSQL database (`crowdfunding_db`). Import the CSV files into their corresponding tables.
